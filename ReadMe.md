*Overview*
    The goal of this project is to take an input and generate a random message using Javascript.  In this instance the input will generate a random movie, then select a character from that movie and generate a random quote from a list. The project will be tracked through a git repository stored on GitHub for future reference.  

*SKills*
    +Demonstrate a knowledge of JavaScript and Git
    +Create a coding plan
    +Execute my plan using JavaScript
    +Track changes to my code using git and GitHub to host it remotely

*Plan* 
My intial idea for writing the code is to create several array's one for movies, one for the characters in that movie and then finally one for the quotes said by the character.  Then  using math.Random it will pick a movie, then pick a charater and then a quote.
